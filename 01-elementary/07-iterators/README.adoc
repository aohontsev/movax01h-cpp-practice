# Task description

The main point of these task is learn how safety working with iterators.
You need check at least 3 potential problems:

  1. Check is iterator have correct value
  2. Check iterator lifetime, especially after container's manipulations
  3. Check correct iterator range, uses same source container, from higher to
least direction when getting slices
